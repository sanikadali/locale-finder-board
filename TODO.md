# Fix Business Content Grid Card Height Inconsistency

## Tasks
- [x] Add "h-full" class to the div wrapping each BusinessCard in Index.tsx
- [x] Add "h-full" class to the Card component in BusinessCard.tsx
- [x] Test the UI to confirm all cards have equal height

## Summary
Fixed the height inconsistency in the business content grid by:
- Adding `h-full` class to the wrapper div around each BusinessCard in the grid layout
- Adding `h-full` class to the Card component itself to ensure it stretches to fill its container
- This ensures all cards in the 4-column grid have equal height, resolving the issue where the first column card was shorter than others
